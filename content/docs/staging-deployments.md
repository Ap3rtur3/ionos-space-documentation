# Staging Deployments
  
![Screenshot from staging deployment section](/staging.jpg)
  
With staging deployments you can preview changes before they go live. If you think of your *main* branch as production, this is most likely the branch you select for your production deployment. droduction deployments can be connected to domains to serve content to visitors. When working on new features, you might not want unfinished code to go live on production. We suggest you to open feature branches for testing purposes and set them up as staging deployments. We equip staging deployments with preview URLs you can use to view changes by yourself or to share them with colleagues or customers. Once your happy with your changes, you can either merge them back to *main* or define the feature branch as the new production branch.
