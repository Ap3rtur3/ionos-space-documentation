# About Us

## We’re on a mission to make hosting fun again

## Our Story

Deploy Now was born April 2021 as a simple way to deploy your GitHub project to [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/).
The idea was born by a team of enthusiastic developers who gain a lot of experience in their daily work for IONOS or by building up their own private projects.

**Our motto is**: _We’re on a mission to make hosting fun again - Hosting with IONOS should be a breeze!_
