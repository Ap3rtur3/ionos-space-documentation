# Introduction

Deploy Now is a hosting platform dedicated to developers. Connect your GitHub account and instantly deploy your web projects on IONOS own DDoS-protected, georedundant and green infrastructure.

## Getting started
  
1. **Connect your GitHub account.** We ask you for the permission to install the [IONOS Deploy Now App](https://github.com/apps/ionos-deploy-now) to your repositories.  
    
1. **Select your deployment source.** We can deploy either repositories within your GitHub account or any public third party repository. No repository at hand? Deploy one of our samples [Link to "samples".

2. **Configure the deployment.** Deploy Now scans your repository to detect the framework and the dist folder. In case we are not able to identify them, we ask you to provide them explicitly.
